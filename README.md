#### File Description 
- `Mutilayer_analysis.ipynb`: Files used to analyze node centrality, including multi-level and single-level degree centrality, between centrality, eigenvector centrality. It is recommended to run it first before other files.

- `demo/attention`: This folder contains test code and demonstration files for testing the replacement attention mechanism.

- `demo/activition`: This folder contains test code and demonstration files for testing the replacement activation function.

- `demo/encoding`:This folder contains test code and demonstration files for testing the replacement encoding method.
